% [USES] Interpolations/NevillePoint
% Function that calculates the Neville interpolation polynomial for a vector
% of points (a, b) with a:xs, b:ys in "elements" points between the first of xs
% and the last of xs; it also plots the interpolation
function [xss yss] = NevilleInterpolation(xs, ys, elements)
    n = length(xs);
    % if "elements" is given, use it; otherwise, use the default value of
    % linspace (usually 100)
    if exist("elements", "var") == 1
        xss = linspace(xs(1), xs(n), elements);
    else
        xss = linspace(xs(1), xs(n));
    endif

    % xss' points

        yss = [yss NevillePoint(0, n - 1, xss(i), xs, ys)];
