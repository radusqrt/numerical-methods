# numerical-methods

#### Repository with the purpose of helping the young ones in need on their path to achieving the computer science wisdom. Contains MATLAB/Octave implementations of the algorithms.

Currently contains:
- Nonlinear equations:
	- Bisection method
	- Newton-Raphson method
	- Secand method
- Gaussian methods:
	- Gaussian elimination
	- Gaussian elimination with Partial Pivoting
	- Gaussian elimination with Scaled Partial Pivoting
	- Gaussian elimination with Total Pivoting
- LU methods:
	- Cholesky
	- Crout
	- Doolittle
- Iterative methods:
	- Gauss-Seidel
	- Jacobi
	- Successive over-relaxation (SOR)
- QR methods:
	- Givens
	- Gram-Schmidt
	- Householder
- Eigenvalues:
	- Deflation method
	- Power method
	- Inverse Power method
- Ad-hoc:
	- Gauss-Jordan (inverse of a matrix)
	- Gershgorin circle theorem
	- Solutions for triangular matrices
	- Diagonally dominance
	- Positive definition

- Before starting working on something, check the "Pull requests" tab to see if there isn't anyone who's already doing the same thing!
- Convention: The sources' names will start with a capital letter: "Crout", "Doolittle", "Householder", "Givens" etc.
- Comment your sources!
- Test your sources with several input cases: eye matrix, full matrix, triu matrix, tril matric, random matrix, small, big etc.
- Use notation tags:
	- [NOTE] for related notes
	- [USES] for sources which use other sources that are in a different folder to suggest that the user should first copy the dependencies (sources needed) in the same folder for testing 
- before creating a Pull Request, it should look like this: [Householder](https://github.com/radusqrt/help-the-kids/blob/master/MN/Algoritmi/QR/Householder/Householder.m)
